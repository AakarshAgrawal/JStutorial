// We have several data types in JavaScript such as 
// Numbers, Booleans, strings, Bigint, Null, Undefined, Symbol.
//for ex:
let name = "Aakarsh"; //string type 
let age = 24; //number type
let Isloggedin = false; // boolean type 
let state; // no value assigned therefore it is Undefined
let surname = null; // Null is an standalone value and represents the value is empty, not undefined.
